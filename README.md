## 🎼 The tablature editor  
Step aside, notepad.exe -- Riffin uses a no-nonsense, custom-built editor that takes the hastle out of writing tablature.

Use the arrow keys or click anywhere on the editor to start riffin

Duplicate chords with **D**

## 💡 Project Inspiration 
Sometimes an idea is just an idea worth writing down.   

The problem is writing tablature in a text editor or scoring software is just too cumbersome for quick ideas, so I started writing on notecards. Trying to organize and quickly find notecards became its own problem.

Riffin was born.
